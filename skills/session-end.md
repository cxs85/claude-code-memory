# Session End — Wrap-Up Protocol

Execute the full session end checklist:

1. **TASKS.md** — Check off completed tasks, add any new tasks discovered during this session
2. **STATUS.md** — Write a session report: what was done, what's next, decisions needed, resources used
3. **IMPLEMENTATION.md** — Refresh the status dashboard table to reflect current reality
4. **CHANGELOG.md** — If any changes this session affect other agents, post an entry
5. **DECISIONS.md** — Log any decisions made this session
6. **SQUAD.md** — Update your status if changed (new capabilities, track changes, etc.)
7. **MEMORY.md** — Record key learnings from this session
8. **PLAYBOOK.md** — Add any new shared learnings (technical discoveries, patterns)
9. **Staleness sweep** — Did you encounter any stale doc during work? Fix it now.

After completing all steps, report a summary of what was updated.
