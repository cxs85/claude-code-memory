## Task Protocol

- **Human assigns** — task appears with `Assigned By: {human}`
- **Agents self-assign** — claim by putting your name in Owner column
- **One owner per task** — split into subtasks if coordination is needed
- **Priority guide:**
  - P0: Drop everything, do this now
  - P1: Do today
  - P2: Do this week
  - P3: Backlog
- **Every status change** gets logged in your daily log
